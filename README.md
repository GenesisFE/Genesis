## Repository Info
> Note: I keep my scripts 📜 in this repository, obviously they are obfuscated, please don't bother asking for the source because I'm unwilling to release it at this time.

You can access my scripts via the ``loadstring`` folder above, it has all the current **GENESIS** scripts, the other three folders: ``Assets``, ``Obfuscations``, and ``Reanimations`` have resources used in my scripts.

## Features

- Hat reanimation using ``FDless`` reanimate by MyWorld
- Permadeath / Looprespawn Hybrid (via settings or flinging with permadeath)
- QOL settings to change how the scripts work on the loadstring
- Variety of converts with optimization as the core focus
